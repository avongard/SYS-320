1. What has been your experience learning bash?

So far learning bash has been a new way to utilize linux commands and coding skills in combination to complete tasks. 
These tasks can be useful tools, scanners, formaters, etc. All useful skills and knowledge for technical jobs.

2. The only thing that could make it better would be more assignments, small ones to ingrain certain methods.

3. Each assignment takes 1-2 hours.

4. Yes I can find not only the skills incredibly useful but the practical use of the the tools and scripts we develop.
